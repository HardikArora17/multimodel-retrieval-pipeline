{"output_questions": [{"QUESTION": "What is Odo and how is it different from Frontier?", "ANSWER": "Odo is a training system that is not intended to be used as an OLCF user resource. It is a 32-node stand-alone system with the same architecture as Frontier, but it resides in the NCCS Open Security Enclave, which has fewer restrictions compared to Frontier's Moderate Security Enclave. Odo is primarily used for OLCF training events and differs from Frontier in terms of the number of compute nodes and the file systems it mounts."}, {"QUESTION": "How many nodes does Odo have, and what are their types?", "ANSWER": "Odo has a total of 32 nodes, out of which two are login nodes, and the remaining 30 are compute nodes."}, {"QUESTION": "Describe the hardware configuration of an Odo compute node.", "ANSWER": "Each Odo compute node consists of one 64-core AMD 'Optimized 3rd Gen EPYC' CPU with 2 hardware threads per physical core and 512 GB of DDR4 memory. Each node also contains 4 AMD MI250X, each with 2 Graphics Compute Dies (GCDs), totaling 8 GCDs per node. Each GCD can be conceptualized as a separate GPU with 64 GB of high-bandwidth memory."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the purpose of the NCCS Open Security Enclave, and how does it affect Odo users?", "ANSWER": "The NCCS Open Security Enclave, where Odo resides, is subject to fewer restrictions compared to the Moderate Security Enclave used by systems like Frontier. This allows for a streamlined approval process for participants in OLCF training events, making access to Odo more efficient."}, {"QUESTION": "What file systems are available to Odo users, and what are their purposes?", "ANSWER": "Odo users have access to several file systems: a personal home (NFS) directory, /ccsopen/home/[userid], for individual access; a project NFS directory, /ccsopen/proj/[projid], for project members; and a GPFS parallel file system called wolf2 with directories for shared project access, user-specific scratch space, and world-shared access for all users."}, {"QUESTION": "Explain the process of obtaining access to Odo for an OLCF training event.", "ANSWER": "To obtain access to Odo, participants must fill out a form with their project ID, select 'Yes' for OLCF as the Project Organization and 'Yes' for Open as the Security Enclave, and proceed through several screens providing personal, shipping, and employment information. They must also agree to policies and, if approved, new users will receive an email to set up a password. Existing users can use their XCAMS/UCAMS credentials."}, {"QUESTION": "What should a user do if they log in to Odo and do not find their home directory?", "ANSWER": "If a user logs in and does not see their home directory, it is likely because the directories take approximately five minutes to be created after the account is set up. Users should wait for this process to complete."}, {"QUESTION": "What credentials are required for logging into Odo, and how does it differ from other OLCF systems?", "ANSWER": "To log in to Odo, users need their XCAMS/UCAMS username and password. Unlike other OLCF systems such as Frontier, logging into Odo does not require an RSA token."}, {"QUESTION": "What should a user do if they do not see their school listed while filling the Employment/Institution Information?", "ANSWER": "If a student's school is not listed, they should choose 'other' for both 'Employer' and 'Funding Source' and manually enter their school affiliation in the adjacent fields."}, {"QUESTION": "In terms of storage, what is the difference between the personal NFS directory and the project NFS directory on Odo?", "ANSWER": "The personal NFS directory, /ccsopen/home/[userid], is accessible only by the individual user for storing personal files and applications. In contrast, the project NFS directory, /ccsopen/proj/[projid], is visible to all project members for collaborative storage and application builds."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the function of the wolf2 file system on Odo?", "ANSWER": "The wolf2 file system is a GPFS parallel file system used for data storage when running on Odo's compute nodes. It includes directories for project-shared access, user-specific scratch space, and world-shared access for all users."}, {"QUESTION": "How should a user indicate their participation in an OLCF training event in the access request form?", "ANSWER": "On the Project Information screen of the access request form, users should fill the 'Proposed Contribution to Project' field with 'Participating in OLCF training' and leave all other project-related questions set to 'no'."}, {"QUESTION": "Describe the approval process for gaining access to Odo.", "ANSWER": "After submitting the application, the request must pass through an approval process, which may take until the next business day. Once approved, new users receive an email to set up a password, while existing users can log in using their current XCAMS/UCAMS credentials."}, {"QUESTION": "What steps should a user take if they forget which shell to select during the account setup process?", "ANSWER": "If unsure of which shell to select, users should choose '/bin/bash' during account setup. This can be changed later if necessary."}, {"QUESTION": "What information is required from users regarding their employment or institution during the access request process?", "ANSWER": "Users must provide their employment or institution information, including their employer and funding source. Students should use their school affiliation for both fields, and if their school is not listed, they should manually enter it."}, {"QUESTION": "Explain the login process for Odo and any specific requirements or differences compared to other systems.", "ANSWER": "To log into Odo, users need their XCAMS/UCAMS username and password. This process does not require an RSA token, which is typically needed for other OLCF systems like Frontier. Users should use the command '$ ssh USERNAME@login1.odo.olcf.ornl.gov' to access the system."}, {"QUESTION": "What are the characteristics of the Graphics Compute Dies (GCDs) in Odo's compute nodes?", "ANSWER": "Each Odo compute node contains 4 AMD MI250X, each with 2 Graphics Compute Dies (GCDs), totaling 8 GCDs per node. Each GCD can be considered a separate GPU, each having 64 GB of high-bandwidth memory."}, {"QUESTION": "How are the GPFS directories under /gpfs/wolf2/[projid] organized, and what are their access permissions?", "ANSWER": "Under /gpfs/wolf2/[projid], the GPFS directories are organized as follows: 'proj-shared' is accessible to all project members, 'scratch' contains user-specific directories accessible only to the respective user, and 'world-shared' is accessible to any users on the system from any project."}, {"QUESTION": "What should users do on the 'Policies & Agreements' page during the access request process?", "ANSWER": "On the 'Policies & Agreements' page, users should click the links to read the policies, affirm they have read each by answering 'Yes', and certify their application by selecting 'Yes'. Then, they should click 'Submit' to complete the process."}, {"QUESTION": "What happens after a user's application for access to Odo is approved?", "ANSWER": "Once a user's application is approved, if they are new, they will receive an email to set up a password. Existing users with an XCAMS/UCAMS account will not receive this email and will use their existing credentials to log in. Once the password is set, users can access Odo using their XCAMS/UCAMS username and password."}]}
