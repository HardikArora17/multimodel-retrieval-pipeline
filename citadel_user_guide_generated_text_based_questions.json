{"output_questions": [{"QUESTION": "What is the purpose of the OLCF's Scalable Protected Infrastructure (SPI)?", "ANSWER": "The purpose of the OLCF's Scalable Protected Infrastructure (SPI) is to provide resources and protocols that enable researchers to process protected data at scale. It is built around a framework of security protocols that allows researchers to process large datasets containing private information on the center's large HPC resources."}, {"QUESTION": "What types of data can be processed using the SPI framework?", "ANSWER": "The SPI framework allows for the processing of data containing protected health information (PHI), personally identifiable information (PII), data protected under International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and other types of data that require privacy."}, {"QUESTION": "How does the SPI differ from standard non-SPI processes?", "ANSWER": "Many processes used within the SPI are similar to those used for standard non-SPI, but the SPI includes specialized resources targeted at SPI workloads. The differences are specifically related to the handling of protected data and the security protocols in place to support this."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the CITADEL security framework, and how is it related to the SPI?", "ANSWER": "The CITADEL security framework is a part of the SPI infrastructure at the NCCS and OLCF. It provides resources and protocols to enable researchers to process protected data securely and at scale, allowing the use of OLCF\u2019s large HPC resources for computing data that requires privacy."}, {"QUESTION": "What was the original purpose for conceiving the CITADEL security framework?", "ANSWER": "The CITADEL security framework was originally conceived to facilitate the large-scale analysis of protected health information (PHI) data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Million Veteran Program."}, {"QUESTION": "What measures have been taken to ensure data privacy within the CITADEL framework?", "ANSWER": "CITADEL enforces security measures for handling vast datasets that require heightened privacy safeguards. Extra precautions ensure that private data cannot be accessed by other researchers or used by other projects, such as keeping HIPAA-protected data separate for different sponsors."}, {"QUESTION": "What accreditation has CITADEL undergone to enable its use for sensitive data?", "ANSWER": "CITADEL has undergone comprehensive technical, legal, and policy-oriented reviews and has received third-party accreditation. This accreditation has opened new possibilities for research projects that previously could not use OLCF systems due to the sensitive nature of their data."}, {"QUESTION": "How has the CITADEL framework expanded beyond its initial prototype?", "ANSWER": "With assistance from ORNL Risk Management and ORNL\u2019s Information Technology Services Division (ITSD), the NCCS SPI team refined the initial prototype of CITADEL and expanded its capabilities to accommodate a diverse array of programs, projects, and sponsors."}, {"QUESTION": "How does the CITADEL framework handle HIPAA-protected data from different sponsors?", "ANSWER": "Under the CITADEL framework, HIPAA-protected data from different sponsors, such as the VA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), is kept absolutely separate to ensure privacy and security."}, {"QUESTION": "What role does the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) play in the SPI's security protocols?", "ANSWER": "The facility adheres to the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s security and privacy controls for moderate Official Use Only data, which informs the security measures implemented in the CITADEL framework for handling protected data."}, {"QUESTION": "What resources does the OLCF provide for computing SPI workflows?", "ANSWER": "The OLCF provides large HPC resources, including Frontier, for computing SPI workflows, allowing researchers to process protected data securely and efficiently."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the significance of the Frontier resources in the context of the SPI?", "ANSWER": "Frontier resources are part of the OLCF's large HPC capabilities that can be used to compute SPI workflows, enabling the processing of large datasets with privacy requirements."}, {"QUESTION": "How has the CITADEL framework impacted research projects that require data privacy?", "ANSWER": "The CITADEL framework has presented new possibilities for research projects that previously could not utilize OLCF systems due to the nature of their data, by providing a secure environment for processing protected information."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the relationship between the NCCS and the OLCF in terms of the SPI?", "ANSWER": "The National Center for Computational Science (NCCS) and the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) have collaborated to implement the CITADEL security framework as part of their Scalable Protected Infrastructure (SPI) to support secure data processing."}, {"QUESTION": "What specific data types does the CITADEL framework cater to in terms of privacy requirements?", "ANSWER": "The CITADEL framework caters to data types such as protected health information (PHI), personally identifiable information (PII), and data protected under International Traffic in Arms Regulations, among other types that require privacy."}, {"QUESTION": "What role do ORNL Risk Management and ITSD play in the development of the CITADEL framework?", "ANSWER": "ORNL Risk Management and ORNL\u2019s Information Technology Services Division (ITSD) assisted the NCCS SPI team in refining the initial prototype of the CITADEL framework and expanding its capabilities."}, {"QUESTION": "How does the SPI infrastructure ensure that data is not shared between researchers or projects?", "ANSWER": "The SPI infrastructure, through its security protocols and the CITADEL framework, ensures that private data is managed with extra precautions so that it cannot be accessed by other researchers or used by other projects."}, {"QUESTION": "How does the SPI framework accommodate different programs and sponsors?", "ANSWER": "The SPI framework, particularly through the expanded capabilities of the CITADEL framework, is designed to accommodate a diverse array of programs, projects, and sponsors by providing tailored security measures and resource allocation."}, {"QUESTION": "What documentation is available for understanding the differences between SPI and non-SPI workflows on Frontier?", "ANSWER": "For details on the Citadel framework and how it differs from the non-SPI Frontier workflows, researchers are directed to the SPI documentation as referenced in the document."}, {"QUESTION": "What challenges did the CITADEL framework address for research projects at the OLCF?", "ANSWER": "The CITADEL framework addressed challenges related to processing protected and sensitive data by providing a secure infrastructure that previously hindered research projects from utilizing OLCF systems due to privacy concerns."}]}
