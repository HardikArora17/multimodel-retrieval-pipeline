{"output_questions": [{"QUESTION": "What is the primary purpose of the Andes cluster?", "ANSWER": "The primary purpose of the Andes cluster is to provide a conduit for large-scale scientific discovery via pre/post processing and analysis of simulation data generated on Frontier."}, {"QUESTION": "How many compute nodes and GPU nodes does Andes have?", "ANSWER": "Andes contains 704 compute nodes and 9 GPU nodes."}, {"QUESTION": "What are the specifications of the compute nodes in the batch partition of Andes?", "ANSWER": "Each compute node in the batch partition contains two 16-core 3.0 GHz AMD EPYC 7302 processors with AMD's Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) Technology and 256GB of main memory. Each CPU features 16 physical cores, for a total of 32 physical cores per node."}, {"QUESTION": "Describe the GPU partition of Andes.", "ANSWER": "The GPU partition of Andes consists of 9 large memory/GPU nodes. Each node has 1TB of main memory, two NVIDIA K80 GPUs, and two 14-core 2.30 GHz Intel Xeon processors with HT Technology. Each CPU features 14 physical cores, for a total of 28 physical cores per node, and with Hyper-Threading enabled, these nodes have 56 logical cores."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the maximum theoretical transfer rate of the Infiniband interconnect in Andes?", "ANSWER": "The maximum theoretical transfer rate of the S8500 Series HDR Infiniband interconnect in Andes is 200 Gb/s."}, {"QUESTION": "How are login nodes on Andes configured?", "ANSWER": "Andes features 8 login nodes that are identical to the batch partition compute nodes. They provide an environment for editing, compiling, and launching codes onto the compute nodes."}, {"QUESTION": "What should users refrain from doing on Andes login nodes and why?", "ANSWER": "Users should refrain from performing CPU- or memory-intensive tasks on Andes login nodes because such tasks could interrupt service to other users."}, {"QUESTION": "Explain how users can connect to Andes.", "ANSWER": "Users can connect to Andes by using the SSH command to connect to andes.olcf.ornl.gov."}, {"QUESTION": "What kind of file system support does Andes provide?", "ANSWER": "Andes provides support for the OLCF's center-wide data-orion-lustre-hpe-clusterstor-filesystem for computational work, an NFS-based file system for user and project home directories, and the OLCF's data-hpss for archival spaces."}, {"QUESTION": "Describe the wrapper provided by OLCF for the lfs setstripe command.", "ANSWER": "The OLCF provides a wrapper for the lfs setstripe command to simplify the process of striping files. This wrapper enforces certain settings to ensure correct striping practices, which helps maintain good performance and prevent filesystem issues."}, {"QUESTION": "What are the recommended settings for using the Orion filesystem effectively?", "ANSWER": "To use the Orion filesystem effectively, users should use the capacity OST pool tier (e.g., lfs setstripe -p capacity) and stripe across no more than 450 OSTs."}, {"QUESTION": "What is Lmod, and how does it benefit users on Andes?", "ANSWER": "Lmod is a Lua-based module system used for dynamically altering shell environments. It benefits users by managing changes to the shell's environment variables, allowing them to alter the software available in their shell environment without the risk of creating incompatible package and version combinations."}, {"QUESTION": "What compilers are available on Andes, and what is the default compiler?", "ANSWER": "The available compilers on Andes are Intel (Intel composer xe, which is the default), PGI (the Portland group compiler suite), and GCC (the GNU compiler collection)."}, {"QUESTION": "How are jobs executed in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments like Andes?", "ANSWER": "In HPC environments like Andes, jobs are executed by preparing executables and input files, writing a batch script, submitting the batch script to the batch scheduler, and optionally monitoring the job before and during execution."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the purpose of using the salloc command in Slurm?", "ANSWER": "The salloc command in Slurm is used to allocate resources and gain interactive access to compute resources, allowing users to run tasks interactively rather than through a batch script."}, {"QUESTION": "How does the OLCF manage software environments on Andes?", "ANSWER": "The OLCF manages software environments on Andes using environment modules provided through Lmod, which allows users to dynamically modify their user environment by using pre-written modulefiles."}, {"QUESTION": "What should users do if they require a different compiler version on Andes?", "ANSWER": "If users require a different compiler version on Andes, they must ensure the compiler's module is loaded and then swap to the correct compiler version using the module system."}, {"QUESTION": "Explain the job scheduling process on Andes.", "ANSWER": "Jobs on Andes are scheduled in full node increments, and the scheduling policies for the individual partitions are designed based on user feedback and analysis of batch jobs. Jobs that do not specify a partition will run in the 704 node batch partition, while access to the 9 node GPU partition requires specifying -p gpu in the batch job submission."}, {"QUESTION": "What are the implications of a project overrunning its allocation on OLCF systems?", "ANSWER": "Projects that overrun their allocation are still allowed to run on OLCF systems but at a reduced priority. The batch system will consider jobs from projects that are over their allocation as having waited for a shorter time, and these jobs will be limited in the amount of wall time they can use."}, {"QUESTION": "What tools does Slurm provide for managing and monitoring jobs?", "ANSWER": "Slurm provides tools like scancel to stop and remove jobs from the queue, scontrol hold and scontrol release to manage job hold states, and utilities like squeue and sacct to view queue, system, and job status."}]}
