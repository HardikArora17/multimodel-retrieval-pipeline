{"output_questions": [{"QUESTION": "What is the timeline for the decommissioning of HPSS and when will it become read-only?", "ANSWER": "HPSS will be decommissioned early in 2025. It will become read-only from all OLCF resources on August 30, 2024, and any data remaining on HPSS after January 31, 2025, will be permanently deleted and no longer accessible."}, {"QUESTION": "What should users do to prepare for the HPSS decommissioning?", "ANSWER": "Users should start migrating needed data from HPSS as soon as possible to avoid running out of time. They are encouraged to use the hsi utility for data transfer and reach out to help@olcf.ornl.gov for coordination of larger data migrations."}, {"QUESTION": "What is Kronos and when will it be available?", "ANSWER": "Kronos is the OLCF's new nearline storage resource, which is multi-tiered containing both disk and tape. It is expected to be available late July 2024. Kronos will provide an initial disk capacity of 134 PB with up to 200 GB/s bandwidth from the center's Data Transfer Nodes."}, {"QUESTION": "How will Kronos be accessible to users?", "ANSWER": "Kronos will be mounted on the moderate Data Transfer Nodes and accessible through the OLCF Kronos collection in Globus. Users can interact with it using standard UNIX commands and tools."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the quota for projects on Kronos and how can it be changed?", "ANSWER": "Each project has a default 200TB quota on Kronos. Users can request quota increases by contacting help@olcf.ornl.gov."}, {"QUESTION": "What are the preferred tools and methods for migrating data from HPSS to Kronos?", "ANSWER": "The preferred method is to use the hsi utility from the DTN, as it is aware of the HPSS tape storage structure. Additionally, the hsi_xfer utility can be used to easily utilize the hsi data list feature for efficient data transfer."}, {"QUESTION": "Why is the Globus utility not recommended for migrating data from HPSS?", "ANSWER": "The Globus utility is not aware of the underlying HPSS tape storage structure, which could lead to inefficient migration. Therefore, the HPSS Globus collection will be disabled on August 30, 2024, to ensure safe and efficient data migration."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the decommissioning timeline for Summit?", "ANSWER": "Summit will be decommissioned on November 15, 2024. Batch jobs will be allowed to execute until 08:00 AM (EST) on that day, after which the machine will be physically disassembled."}, {"QUESTION": "What changes will occur to Alpine2 on November 19, 2024?", "ANSWER": "On November 19, 2024, Alpine2 will be unmounted from Andes and will be mounted read-only from the Data Transfer Nodes to allow time for data migration."}, {"QUESTION": "When will data remaining on Alpine2 be permanently deleted?", "ANSWER": "Data remaining on Alpine2 will be permanently deleted on January 31, 2025, and will no longer be accessible after this date."}, {"QUESTION": "What should users do if they experience extended retrieval delays during data migration from HPSS?", "ANSWER": "Users should reach out to help@olcf.ornl.gov with concerns about extended retrieval delays during data migration from HPSS."}, {"QUESTION": "How will the hsi_xfer utility assist in data migration from HPSS?", "ANSWER": "The hsi_xfer utility will recursively copy directories from HPSS to Kronos, creating necessary data lists and calling hsi behind the scenes. It requires full paths for both source and destination directories."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the best practice for using the hsi utility for data migration?", "ANSWER": "The best practice is to create a list file and call hsi once, rather than making successive hsi get calls. This ensures efficient retrieval of data stored on tape."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the limitation on the hsi_xfer utility usage?", "ANSWER": "To maximize the availability of transfer resources, there is a limit of one active hsi_xfer operation per user."}, {"QUESTION": "What should users do if they need to delete data from the HPSS?", "ANSWER": "Due to the added overhead of data deletion, users are asked not to delete data from the HPSS."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the capacity and bandwidth of Kronos?", "ANSWER": "Kronos will provide an initial disk capacity of 134 PB and is capable of bandwidth of up to 200 GB/s from the center's Data Transfer Nodes."}, {"QUESTION": "Why is it important to consider physical tape access overhead when planning data migration?", "ANSWER": "Physical tape access overhead can lead to longer retrieval times for data stored only on tape compared to data stored on disk. Users should consider this when planning their data migration."}, {"QUESTION": "What is the recommended method for transferring data from HPSS to Kronos?", "ANSWER": "The recommended method is to utilize the hsi utility from the DTN, as it provides the best performance and is aware of the HPSS tape storage structure."}, {"QUESTION": "What will happen to batch jobs on Summit after November 15, 2024?", "ANSWER": "Batch jobs will be allowed to execute until 08:00 AM (EST) on November 15, 2024. Jobs remaining in the queue after this time will be deleted, and the machine will be physically disassembled."}, {"QUESTION": "What should users do to manage workflows requiring Alpine2 before its unmounting?", "ANSWER": "Users should manage their workflows such that Andes batch jobs requiring Alpine2 will complete prior to its unmounting on November 19, 2024, as these jobs will fail after this date."}]}
